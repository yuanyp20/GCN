# GCN_LSTM_FOR_OIL

## Environment：
pytorch 1.9

## Data
The data of this project is not available for the time being, but the dimension of the original data is：Sensors(16) x Data acquisition time. For example, the data format that we use 16 sensors to collect in 1 second(50 hz) is: 16 * 50.
## How to run 10 independent experiments at a time？ 
<br>Classification and regression tasks:<br>
Classification task: bash start_py_1.sh<br>
Regression task: Be the same as the above

## How to run an experiment independently？

python train_cnn.py
